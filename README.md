## Skills in Action: Project-Driven Expertise

My technical skills are best illustrated by the practical application in my projects, which align with my core interests in data analysis, security, and automation.

* **Quantitative Economic Research (Seafood Econometrics)**
    This project demonstrates my ability to conduct in-depth data analysis. By using **Python (Pandas)** and **SQL**, I am quantitatively exploring historical economic trends, applying inflation adjustments and simultaneous equation models to derive meaningful insights from complex datasets.

* **Automated & Containerized System Monitoring**
    Reflecting my interest in reproducible systems, I engineered a solution to monitor storage on a high-performance Linux system. This tool leverages **Python, R, and PostgreSQL** and is fully containerized with **Docker/Podman**. Its integration with a **REST API** showcases my ability to create robust, end-to-end automated solutions.

* **Web Data Extraction & Analysis**
    In this project, I developed a containerized **Python** application using **BeautifulSoup 4** to monitor and report text-based changes on web pages. This highlights my skills in web scraping and packaging software for easy distribution and use.

* **Large-Scale Lexical & Sentiment Analysis**
    This initiative utilizes the PushShift Reddit dataset and its **RESTful API** to analyze language patterns across online communities. The project relies on **Python** and **Pandas** to process large volumes of text data, demonstrating my capability to work with big data and external APIs to conduct sentiment analysis.
